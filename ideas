Aim:

Create a program that chooses a team given a budget before the first gameweek
Update the team weekly (if necessary) with one free transfer
Choose a captain and vice captain for each week
Won't include consideration for powerups/wildcards

Method:

Need to create heuristic for how good players are of players
Ideally want to maximise overall heuristic within a budget

Could pick best team possible, then remove players with lower level replacements till budget is met

Measure:
 Average Points per week in previous season
 Only count weeks where minutes are greater than 0


Select best players by measure
Remove weakest players and replace with next cheapest option if over budget
May need to consider price when removing, to avoid having a really cheap team with some star players
